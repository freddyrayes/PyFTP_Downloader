# PyFTP_Downloader

This python program will compare a specific FTP directory with a local directory.
If files are found in the FTP server and are not in the local directory then it will proceed to download those missing files.

In the same directory as the main python file will need to be a login.txt file.
#The text file should contain on a seperate line for each:
  address of server
  username
  password
