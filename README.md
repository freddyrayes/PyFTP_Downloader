# PyFTP_Downloader
This python program will compare a specific FTP directory with a local directory.
If files are found in the FTP server and are not in the local directory then it will proceed to download those missing files.

In the same directory as the main python file, you will need to create a login.txt file.

The text file should contain the login details on a seperate line for each:
-address of server
-username
-password

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 
Requires Python 3.x
